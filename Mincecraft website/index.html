		<h2 id="gamemodes"> Gamemodes </h2>
		<h4 id="sm"> SURVIVAL MODE </h4>
		<p>In this mode, your objective is to survive. You will spawn in your world (in a randmly decided spawn point), and you must immediately start to gather and craft items so you can create a shelter
		(either by placing blocks, or carving out a hollow in a mountain or the ground). The objective is normally to have your shelter built before the first night, because your shelter is the main thing 
		protecting you from the monsters that spawn in the night (i.e. zombes, creepers). When you die, and you will in he game, you respawn at your spawn point, which has a changeable location. to show 
		your health level (determines what it will take to kill you in your state) there is a health bar. There is also a hunger bar. At 9-10 points, you can regen health, any lower and you cannot.
		There is an oxygen bar as well if you are under water. When the oxygen bar runs out, you start to lose health. When you come up, you have to wait for a bit for your Oxygen to regenerate. 
		There are also difficulty levels in the gamemodes: peaceful, easy, normal, and hard. These can be changed in-game, and they determine how many monsters spawn at night, how much damage they do, 
		what equipement they will spawn with (if any) and also how much damage you will take if your hunger bar runs out. there are also neutral and friendly creatures, some of which who could attack you, 
		but only in certain conditions. For example, Chickens and Villagers are passive, but Wolves will attack you if you attack them, unless you tame them with a bone.
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Survival">More detail</a></p>
		<br>
		<h4 id="cm"> CREATIVE MODE </h4>
		<p>Basically survival mode, but you have can't get hurt and no hunger or oxygen bar. you also have access to every item in the game, including ones that you are normally unable to get in survival 
		mode, like spawn eggs, which are eggs that when used spawn a specific creature. For example, a wolf spawn egg will spawn in a wolf. Although chickens do lay eggs, these have a possibility of spawining 
		in a chicken. Chicken spawn eggs will guarantee a spawned chicken. You also have acces to the ability to fly, and if cheats are on in that world, you can switch gamemodes, as well as control the entire 
		world, with changing the weather and time of day by typing in a few simple commands. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creative">More detail</a> </p>
		<br>
		<h4 id="am"> ADVENTURE MODE </h4>
		<p> This mode is mainly used for Adventure maps and whatnot, but in general, it is survival mode, but restricted. You can only
		break certain blocks with your hands, some blocks other than Bedrock will be indestructible, and tools can only break certain blocks as well, 
		assuming the have the appropriate tags.</p>
		<br>
		<h4 id="spm"> SPECTATOR MODE </h4>
		<p>In spectator mode, you can fly through blocks, see what other entities are seeing by left-clicking on them, and you're completely invisible to everything except for 
		other spectators. You can't interact with anything. When in third-person mode, you look like a translucent, floating head with no body. You can use the 
		scroll wheel to adjust your flight speed, unlike flying in creative mode.</p>
		<br>
		<h4 id="hm"> HARDCORE MODE </h4>
		<p>This is Survival mode, but locked at the hardest difficulty, and you cannot respawn. if you die, you are dead in this world and you have to delete it. </p>
		<br>
		<h2 id="tandw"> Tools and Weapons </h2>
		<p>Tools are the main components of Minecraft: they help you do everything you need to. They are some of the most important 
		components of the game. Without a pickaxe, for example, you can't even collect anything like stone, Without a hoe, you can't farm, etc.
		These factors make tools some of the most important parts of a Minecraft world.</p>
		<br>
		<h4 id="pick"> Pickaxe </h4>
		<p> The first tool you should ever build is a wooden pickaxe, as that way you can upgrade from wood tools to stone ones in your first day. 
		The pickaxe is the only tool that lets you collect most blocks, like stone, ores, and cobblestone after being placed/found. you need ores 
		because you will need to craft torches as soon as possible in your minecraft survival world (coal), as well as for upgrades on your other tools 
		so you can craft more and new things, like buckets, and enchanting tables. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe">More detail</a></p> 
		<h4 id="axe"> Axe </h4>
		<p> The axe is a useful, but not necessary tool. The best time to get one is when you have a small base set up, with a stone sword and pickaxe at least,
		as well as a large stockpile of stone. The axe is used mainly to get wood faster, and wooden pickaxes are often considered useless, so start by getting 
		a stone one first, but they are also not necessary whatsoever. All they do is make getting wood a bit easier and faster. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="hoe"> Hoe </h4>
		<p> This tool is important, but only in the beginning. A hoe is a tool used for farming purposes, to till the ground to get you started. Apart from that, a hoe is useless, 
		so dont waste any valuble resources on it. Wood is still slightly valuble, but stone, once you have been mining for a while, should be in abundance for you, plus, it has an OK durability, 
		meaning that for a hoe, it will last nearly forever unless you build a massive farm. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hoe">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="shovel"> Shovel </h4>
		<p> The shovel is mainly used for aid in digging up soft blocks, like wool, or dirt. That is all it is used for, mainly increases digging spees, which is very useful for large scale projects.
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="Sword"> Sword </h4>
		<p> The sword is one of the most basic weapons, and the first one many players g=create is a stone sword, crafted with a stick and two cobblestones. The sword has a fast attack rate, 
		the fastest in the game for melee weapons, so it is a pretty good startoff weapon before specializing for situations. It has an ability: Sweeping Strike. This happens at random, 
		causing a white arc of sorts to appear on your screen, symbolizing the path of the blade, as it hits some of the entities beside the targetted entity, causing lowered damage to 
		the side entities, but equal knockback, which helps out with large hordes/armies as well as escaping. Its drawback is ranged weapons, as the knockback allows the enemy more time 
		to reload in order to take you down. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sword">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="trid"> Trident </h4>
		<p> The trident is a melee/ranged hybrid. You can use it to stap around at your foes, but can also charge it up, and then throw it like a spear, however it will 
		land on the ground in the enemy area if you throw it. This weapon, although it has a higher attack damage than the sword, it has a slower attack rate, and this lets 
		diamond swords (swords made from diamond) overpower tridents in melee battle. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Trident">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="bow"> Bow and Arrow </h4>
		<p> The bow and arrow is the basic ranged weapon, which, when you charge (load) it, will fire an arrow. These arrows gan be given special effects, from healing the 
		creatures they hit, to lighting them up. This weapaon, when aiming long distance, has an arc to be accounted for - the gravity pulling on the arrow. After you create the bow, 
		you need arrows, or else it doesn't work. It does a little more damage than a trident when fully charged up, and it has a little more range. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bow">More detail</a></p>
		<h4 id="cross"> Crossbow </h4>
		<p> This weapon, like the bow, is ranged, but has two distinctive features: it can shoot fireworks, and it can be fully charged and keep that charge when in the inventory 
		(Tridents and Bows don't do this). It also has higher damage and a little more range than a bow, but the charge time is slower. <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Crossbow">More detail</a></p>
